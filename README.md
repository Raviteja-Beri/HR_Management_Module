# Setting Up Your HR Management Project on GitHub

Follow these steps to create and manage your HR Management project on GitHub:

---

## 1. Create a GitHub Repository

- **Go to GitHub**: Log in to your GitHub account.
- **Create a new repository**:
  1. Click on the **"New"** button and then **"New repository"**.
  2. Give your repository a descriptive name (e.g., `hr-management`).
  3. Add a brief description of the project.
  4. Choose whether to make it **public** or **private**.
  5. Optionally, initialize the repository with a `README.md` file.

---

## 2. Clone the Repository

1. Open your terminal: Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
2. Use the `git clone` command:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
Replace <repository_url> with the URL of your newly created GitHub repository.
## 3. Add Files and Folders
Create the directory structure:

Create the necessary directories and files within your local repository as defined in your project plan (e.g., `src/`, `tests/`, `documentation/`, `config/`).
Add files:

Add the relevant files to their respective directories (e.g., `employeeController.js`, `Employee.js`, `server.js`).
## 4. Stage Changes
Use git add to stage your changes:
To add specific files:
```bash
git add <file_name>
```
Example:
```bash
git add src/api/controllers/employeeController.js
```
To add all changes:
```bash
git add .
```
## 5. Commit Changes
Use `git commit` to save your changes with a meaningful message:
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
Replace `Initial commit` with a descriptive message explaining the changes.
## 6. Push Changes to GitHub
Push your committed changes to the GitHub repository:
```bash
git push origin main
```
Replace `main` with the name of your default branch (usually `main` or `master`).
## 7. Subsequent Changes
For every set of changes you make:

# a.Stage changes:

```bash
git add .
```
# b. Commit changes:

```bash
git commit -m "<message>"
```
Replace <message> with a meaningful description.

# c. Push changes:

```bash
git push origin main
```
## 8. (Optional) Create Branches
Create a `new branch`:

```bash
git branch <branch_name>
```
Example:

```bash
git branch feature/new-employee-form
```
Switch to the `new branch`:

```bash
git checkout <branch_name>
```
Make changes on the new branch.

Merge the branch back into `main`:

Switch to the` main` branch:
```bash
git checkout main
```
Merge the changes:
```bash
git merge <branch_name>
```
Push the merged changes to GitHub:
```bash
git push origin main
```
## Key Considerations
`README.md`:

Add a well-written `README.md` file to your repository. This file should include:
An overview of the project.
Instructions on how to run the application.

`.gitignore`:

Create a `.gitignore` file to specify files and directories that should not be tracked by Git (e.g.,` node_modules`, temporary files).
## Regular Commits:

Make frequent and small commits with descriptive messages to keep your project history clean and easy to understand.
